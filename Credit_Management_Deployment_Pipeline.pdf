# Deployment Pipeline Description for Credit Management API

**Overview:**  
This document describes the deployment strategy for the Credit Management API from development to production environments.

---

## 1. Development Environment

- Local development on FastAPI with PostgreSQL.  
- Use .env file to configure database credentials.  
- Test all endpoints locally using Postman or Swagger UI.  
- Version control using Git.  

---

## 2. Staging Environment

- Deploy to a staging server to simulate production.  
- Use Docker to containerize the application:  
  - Create a Dockerfile for FastAPI app.  
  - Use docker-compose to run the app with PostgreSQL.  
  - Configure environment variables for staging (.env.staging).  
  - Test background job scheduler and all endpoints thoroughly.  
- CI/CD pipeline:  
  - Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to automate deployment.  
  - On merge to staging branch, pipeline builds Docker image, pushes it to a container registry, and deploys to staging.  

---

## 3. Production Environment

- Deploy the application to AWS or Heroku.  
- Steps:  
  - Pull latest tested Docker image from registry.  
  - Run app in production mode with proper environment variables (.env.prod).  
  - Use AWS RDS for managed PostgreSQL or Heroku Postgres.  
  - Use AWS ECS / Fargate or Heroku dynos for container hosting.  
- Configure monitoring and logging:  
  - CloudWatch / Heroku logs to track API performance and errors.  
- Schedule background jobs:  
  - Use APScheduler inside the container or a separate cron job on production server.  
- Security:  
  - Use environment variables for secrets.  
  - Enable SSL for API endpoints.

## 4. Continuous Integration & Deployment

- CI/CD Workflow:  
  - Run automated tests on every push to main or staging.  
  - Linting and static code checks using flake8 / mypy.  
  - Build Docker image only if tests pass.  
  - Deploy to staging automatically, and to production upon manual approval.
